Marsohod3GW2 board is based on GOWIN GW1NR-LV9QN88PC6/I5 FPGA.
This is same FPGA as TangNano9K board.

Besides that, on top of Marsohod3GW2 we can install 7segment+4button extension shield. This makes board usage for LABs much better.

Board description is here https://marsohod.org/projects/marsohod3gw-prj
Also thre are some separate FPGA projects for this board.

Github repo for those separate FPGA demo projects is here:

Use branch Marsohod3GW2_GW1NR-LV9QN88PC6I5
